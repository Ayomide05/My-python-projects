1. ### Tic-Tac-Toe Game
    Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player strategy game played on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to be the first player to get three of their marks (either "X" or "O") in a row, column, or diagonal. Players take turns placing their marks on the grid, with "X" always going first. The game continues until one player achieves the winning condition or until the grid is full, resulting in a draw.
2. ### Blackjack CArd Game
    Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular card game that combines elements of skill, strategy, and chance. The game is played with one or more decks of standard playing cards. The objective of Blackjack is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, without exceeding 21. Number cards are worth their face value, face cards are worth 10, and an Ace can be worth 1 or 11, depending on which value benefits the player more, Players are dealt two cards initially, and they have the option to "hit" (draw additional cards) or "stand" (keep their current hand). The game also includes options like "double down," "split," and "surrender" for more advanced strategies. Blackjack is a thrilling game of strategy, risk assessment, and suspense, making it a popular choice in casinos worldwide.
